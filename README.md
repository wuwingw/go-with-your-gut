# Go With Your Gut
A simple one-page webapp to help the indecisive be decisive.

## The Idea
Say you want to decide where to go on your next holiday. Find a photo for each place on Google Images, paste the URLs into Go With Your Gut, and by comparing them pairwise side-by-side and relying on your gut reactions, the winning location will be revealed.

### Try It Out

## Motivation
This was just a quick project thrown together for fun during August 2015. Will polish it up further one day!
